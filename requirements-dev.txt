# Development and testing dependencies

# For static analysis and linting (choose one or more)
# flake8
# pylint
# mypy # For type checking, often used with Pyright or as an alternative
# pyright (Typically installed as a Node.js package or VS Code extension, not via pip for CLI use by this name)

# For type stubs (if not provided by the library itself or for older libraries)
# These are often found in typeshed and installable via pip.
# Check PyPI for the exact package names if needed.
# Example:
# types-python-dateutil
# types-feedparser
# types-requests
# types-lxml
# types-beautifulsoup4

# For running tests (unittest is built-in)
# coverage # For test coverage reporting (e.g., `pip install coverage`)

# For formatting
# black
# isort

# Other useful tools
# ipython # For interactive sessions
# pre-commit # For running checks before commits
# tox # For testing in multiple environments
